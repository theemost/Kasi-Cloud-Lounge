                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    Kasi Cloud Lounge started in 2022 when a group of friends from
                    Soweto decided that the township needed more than just taverns and
                    corner chill spots. They wanted a safe, stylish place where people
                    could gather, relax, and enjoy good vibes without having to travel to the city.
                    It began with just two shisha pipes, a couple of fold-up tables, and a Bluetooth
                    speaker in a backyard. Word spread fast friends told friends, Instagram posts started
                    popping, and soon the backyard was too small for the crowd. In early 2023, they secured
                    a small venue on a busy street in the Vilakazi street, Soweto, painted it with bold kasi
                    colours, added comfortable seating, LED lighting, and a menu of shisha flavours inspired
                    by local tastes. Now, Kasi Cloud Lounge is a buzzing hangout every weekend, part shisha bar,
                    part social hub, where you can watch a soccer match, meet new people, or just enjoy the smoke
                    clouds, authentic kasi cuisine and music to drift into the night air.
